                                            Drink To Go Online Cafe (DTGCafe) Mini-project

Group (3 – 4 persons) based project combining some programming concepts and F# programming. To be presented on the 25th of March
Given the current situation around the world, a need for an online solution for selling products has become a defacto standard. 
For instance, consider developing a Drink To Go online café solution. It involves developing a simple application that allow users 
(eg., people at VIA university) to buy drinks through their computer or mobile phone. In order to develop this application, a model 
for describing all the different categories of drinks as well as their prices need to be developed.

In this “first sprint” of the mini-project, you will design data type to represent the different types of drinks in the shop/café/ 
and implement the price calculation function. You need to decide for yourself the prices for the different drinks. For instance, 
the drinks can be different types of coffee, tea, juice, soda, milk, together with their corresponding sizes (Small, Medium, and Large) 
and should have different prices.

The types should have at least:

    • 3 different types of coffee drink
    • 3 different types of tea drink
    • 3 different types of juice drink

You will be calculating the different prices for the above drinks depending on the type and size of the drink.

Sprint 1:

You are allowed to develop your own strategy for describing the different drinks and 
their sizes as well as functions that calculate the prices for a given type of drink.
As a minimum, you should define a simple data type for describing the different drinks 
and implement a function to calculate the price. Hints: You will need to define the data 
type for drinks (union) and the three chosen category, whether coffee or tea or juice 
together with the size (record). You will also need to define the price calculation function 
that uses pattern matching.
